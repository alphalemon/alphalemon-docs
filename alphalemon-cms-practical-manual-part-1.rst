Edit a block
------------
Editing a block is really simple: just click on an editable block to open the editor.
Let's see this operation in detail.

Image block
~~~~~~~~~~~

Place the cursor over the products first image and left click to open the editor.

Click into the src input box to open the **media library**. This tool allows you to manage each
type of file on your website. For this example you will be able to manage images files.

Upload an image. I've already uploaded the images bundled with the bootbusiness original 
theme. Next double click on the one you want to insert.

A green alert tells you the image has been added and the images's path is written back 
into the src input box. Close the media library.

Change the Title and Alt information to introduce text to describe
the image. This information is important for SEO.

Click save button to confirm.

Text block
~~~~~~~~~~

Place your cursor over the text below the image and left click to edit the content.
Type some text to describe your product, then click the save button to confirm.


Remove a block
--------------

Put your mouse over the button below the text you have just edited and click on the trash icon
to remove the block.

You will be prompted to confirm the operation: click ok.


Add a new block
---------------

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img6.jpg

When you remove the last block, AlphaLemon CMS writes some significative text into the 
block's area. This explains that the slot does not contains any content: place the cursor 
over that block and click on the plus icon.

A panel that contains all the available blocks is displayed. Click on the Buttons Group
block to add it into the empty slot.

Manage a list of blocks
-----------------------

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img8.jpg

Place the cursor near one of the buttons to highlight the block's container, then click
into the block's area.

A red trash icon is displayed under each button and a blue plus icon is displayed after
the last button.

Remove an included block from a composite block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we are going to remove a button. In this case it is not important which button 
is removes, so click one of the trash icons and confirm your choice.

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img11.jpg

Now place your cursor over the first button and click on it to open the editor.

Type "Buy now" into the "Button text" input and choose "primary" from the "Button type" 
combobox, then click "Save" to confirm.

Do the same with the nearing button but only change the "Button text" in "Read more".

Place your cursor into the products container's area and click into it.

And an included block into a composite block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click on the plus icon button to add a new product.

Place the cursor over the first product container's area and click into it to open 
the editor to change the product's width.
