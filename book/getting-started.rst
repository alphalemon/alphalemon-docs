Getting started
===============

AlphaLemon CMS is a Content Management System application, built on top of Symfony2
Framework and Twitter Bootstrap.

What does it mean that sentence? Let's explain it!

A **Content Management System (CMS)** is a particular application that let you manage
website contents directly into your browser, which is the native place where a website
lives. 

Usually you are not required to have programming skills to use this kind of software.

**Symfony2** is a PHP framework. A framework is a set of libraries designed with the 
pourpose to semplify common tasks, like proving a robust security layer, providing the tools
to prevent your website from common attacks, providing a routing system to manage the 
website navigation, providing the tools to interact with a database and more.

Symfony2 had been choosen because it is really powerful and easy to use and due to its
huge community.

If you decide to use AlphaLemon CMS to build your website, you must understand that you
choose to build a Symfony2 website, so, you may thrust me that this framework is really
awesome, but you are encouraged to `learn more about it`_.

**Twitter Bootstrap** is a collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. 
It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, charts, 
navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

This framework helps to build a website that looks fine, without the effort to design everything 
from the scratch.

AlphaLemon CMS default theme is a professional looked theme build on top of this framework,
which has easily been adapted for our application. 

Give a look to their `official gallery`_ where are shown several websites made on top of 
Twitter Bootstrap.

If that sounds like you, then immediately learn `how to install`_ your first AlphaLemon 
CMS application.
