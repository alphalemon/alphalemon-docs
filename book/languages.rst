Manage website languages
========================

This chapter explains in detail how to manage website languages.


The panel interface

Website languages are managed using the **Languages panel**: click the **Languages** 
button on the main toolbar placed at the top of the page to open it.

The panel is divided in two columns: the bigger placed on the left contains the interface 
to manage a language's attributes, while on the right there is a list which contains all 
the website languages.


Add a new language
------------------
To add a new language, simply choose the one you want to add to your website from 
the **Language** combobox, then click the  **Save** button.

If you want that the new language will become the website main language check the 
**Is main** checkbox.

The website's main language is the first language displayed when a user, that browses 
your website, does not require any specific language, for example http://alphalemon.com 
address.

When you add a new language, AlphaLemon CMS copies all the main language contents 
to the new language, generates a temporary permalink for each page, prefixing it with 
the new language name, and updates the linked permalinks for the new language's contents.


Select and de-select a language
-------------------------------

To select a language you must choose it from the languages list on the right, clicking 
on the language name. 

To deselect a language, just click on the selected one.

Edit a language
---------------

To edit a language you must first select it from the languages list, then you can 
choose a new language from the **Language** combobox.

When you want to change the website main language, you must select the language you 
want to promote and edit it checking the **Is main** checkbox. 

You cannot degrade the current main language, this means you cannot unckeck  the **Is main**
checkbox for the main language.

Click the **Save** button to confirm your changes.

Delete a language
-----------------

To delete a language you must first select it, then you must click the **Delete**
button placed under the languages list.

You will be promped to confirm the operation.

The main language cannot be removed from the website, so, when you need to remove it
you must first promote another language as main.
